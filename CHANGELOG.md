# 0.1.0 - First Release
* Outline View
* Autosave when outline view enabled.

## 0.1.1 - Patch
* Fixed [#3](https://github.com/kcyarn/markdown-document/issues/3)

# 0.2 - Second Release
* Outline view automatically refreshes on save.
* Outline view highlights possible errors (i.e. non-sequential headers) as warnings.
* Removed manual refresh button. Refresh command still works, but will likely be removed in later versions as refresh now happens on save.
* Fixed [#4](https://github.com/kcyarn/markdown-document/issues/4)
