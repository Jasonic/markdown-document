## Features

### Outline View

- **Expandable Outline View**
- **Click to go to header**

When adding new headers to the document, the Outline View does not automatically refresh. You must manually refresh the view.  

### Autosave

- **Saves as you write!**
  * Go to Settings(ctrl-,) -> Packages -> markdown-document -> Settings -> Set "Enable Autosave"

At present, autosave is only available for markdown files when the outline view is visible. It is not available for non-markdown files. Autosave may become its own package in the future or become available outside the outline view. Please weigh in on [Issue ]()
